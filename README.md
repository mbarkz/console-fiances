In this Challenge, I'll be using the concepts you've learned to create a financial analysis tool.

Aims:
- Show total number of months included in the dataset.
- Display the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- Display the average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period. 
- Display Tte greatest increase/decrease in profits (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

## Notes/Challenges

I found this difficult. Having not worked with JavaScript in the past, or for that matter any programming language which is not HTML or CSS, I found I was trying to tackle and understand these concepts for the first time. 

Intitially, I was unable to track the difference between each month in the multidimesonal array.

I was similalry unable to track the total and therefore average of these figures.

It wasn't able to figure these aspects by googling or by other means, I had to resort to asking a friend to help me understand how to tackle these tasks.

In the end, with the help of a friend, I managed to complete the challenge.

## Usage
